    {
      "question": "What is climate change?",
      "answer": "Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities are currently driving an unprecedented rate of change."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
      "answer": "The main causes of climate change are human activities, such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes, which increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does climate change affect the environment?",
      "answer": "Climate change affects the environment in numerous ways, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and ice caps, shifts in ecosystems and wildlife habitats, and increased ocean acidity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can individuals do to combat climate change?",
      "answer": "Individuals can combat climate change by reducing energy consumption, using renewable energy sources, minimizing waste, supporting sustainable practices, advocating for policy changes, and raising awareness about the issue."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Paris Agreement?",
      "answer": "The Paris Agreement is an international treaty adopted in 2015, aiming to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to keep it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Countries commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing their resilience to climate impacts."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does deforestation contribute to climate change?",
      "answer": "Deforestation contributes to climate change by reducing the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When forests are cleared, the carbon stored in trees is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the economic impacts of climate change?",
      "answer": "Climate change has significant economic impacts, including damage to property and infrastructure from extreme weather events, increased costs for disaster relief and recovery, loss of agricultural productivity, and shifts in energy demand and supply."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does climate change affect human health?",
      "answer": "Climate change affects human health through increased heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems from poor air quality, spread of infectious diseases, food and water insecurity, and mental health issues related to climate-related stress and displacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of renewable energy in addressing climate change?",
      "answer": "Renewable energy plays a crucial role in addressing climate change by providing cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions and can help reduce our reliance on carbon-intensive energy sources."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important to address climate change now?",
      "answer": "It is important to address climate change now to mitigate its most severe impacts, protect ecosystems, ensure a sustainable future for the next generations, and minimize economic and health-related costs. Early action increases the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation efforts."
